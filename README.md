# 🖼️ Image Similarity Finder 

With the increasing variety of fashion products available online, customers often struggle to find items visually similar to what they have in mind. This project addresses that challenge by building an **Image Similarity Finder** that retrieves visually similar fashion items based on a user-provided image. Instead of relying on user purchase history or ratings, this system uses **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** techniques powered by deep learning to match products based on their visual features.

## 📌 Introduction
The solution allows users to upload an image of any fashion product and instantly find visually similar items from a product catalog. This is achieved by extracting feature embeddings of images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and performing a nearest-neighbor search. Such systems help improve product discovery in e-commerce by enabling intuitive image-based search.

## ⚙️ Proposed Methodology
1. **Feature Extraction:** Pre-trained CNN models (**ResNet50 with transfer learning**) are used to extract high-dimensional feature embeddings from product images.  
2. **Database Creation:** Each item in the catalog is processed to store its feature vector in the database.  
3. **Similarity Search:** When a user uploads an image, its feature vector is computed and compared using **Cosine Similarity** against the database.  
4. **Top Matches:** The system returns the **top 5 most visually similar images**.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **[Fashion Product Images Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)** for training and evaluation, which contains thousands of product images across multiple categories.

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **high retrieval accuracy** with visually coherent matches.  
- Leveraged **transfer learning** and `scikit-learn`'s **Nearest Neighbors** for efficient search.  
- Can retrieve and display results with **low latency**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning and transfer learning  
- **scikit-learn** – Nearest Neighbor search  
- **OpenCV, Pillow** – Image processing  
- **Streamlit** – Web-based front-end for image uploads and results display  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The **Image Similarity Finder** offers a simple yet powerful way to search fashion products by images, improving user experience in e-commerce platforms. By using **CNN-based feature extraction** and **content-based image retrieval**, it provides accurate matches without relying on user behavior data.
